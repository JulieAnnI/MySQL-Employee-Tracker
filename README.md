  ## Description
  
  The purpose of this project is to create an interface that makes it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information storedd in databaes. I was tasked to build a solution for managing a company's employee database using node, inqurier, and MySQL.

  ## Installation
  
  To use this interface, open terminal and clone this repo. Navigate into the app folder. If you have not already, download [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). You must also download [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) and have [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/) installed. Once you have done this, type the command "npm start" into the terminal. The database will initialize and you will be prompted with many options to manipulate or view the database. 
  
  ## Usage
  
  This Employee Tracker can be used to simplify a company database of  employees, roles, and departments. The database can easily manipulated by anyone with very little prior knowledge of working with databases. I can see this project in the future having a lot more functionality, such  as deleting employees, or seeing various tables made up of different combinations of those columns in three tables that do exist.
